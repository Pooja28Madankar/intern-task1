            Basically, the recipe is made in wide Pot which is called as Handi, form that handi name is given to this recipe which is prepared in wide-pot but in house, there is no any facility regarding wide-pot so we make in general kadai. Yet the cooking techniques and recipes remain the same which gives the same taste. Generally, in restaurants, Veg Handi is served in round shape Pot, which is called as “Handi.” Though I didn’t have it to serve, so I served it in a serving bowl.

            Veg Handi is a simple mixed vegetable curry recipe, which is prepared with onion, tomato, ginger, garlic and cashew paste. And if you want to go for Jain Version then just leave onion, garlic and ginger in the recipe. And served with roti, naan and rice..

        <p>
            Veg handi recipe is easy and simple and has been inspired from the cookbook – “On the butter chicken trail: a moti mahal cookbook“.

Just a bit prep work is required to prepare the cashew paste and steaming the veggies. After that its a breeze. I have also cooked the veggies in the gravy, but I prefer to steam the veggies separately and do the remaining prep work, when the veggies are steaming. Paneer cubes can also be added along with the veggies. You can also add tinned fruit cocktail towards the end in the recipe.

Veg handi is best served with tandoori rotis or naan or parathas or rotis
        </p>
        For this veg diwani handi, the gravy or base is made from cashew paste, onion-tomatoes and cream. A bit sweet, mild and creamy gravy. Generally, the veggies are fried or sauteed. I have steamed the vegetables.
