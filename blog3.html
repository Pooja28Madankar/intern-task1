            Paneer Lababdar is an easy-to-prepare, restaurant-style dish of paneer (cottage cheese cubes) in a creamy,
             mildly tangy and faintly sweet gravy. Onions, tomatoes, cashews and spices make this a rich, flavorful and
             delicious recipe. This vegetarian Paneer Lababdar recipe is also naturally gluten-free.

        <p>
            Paneer lababdar gravy is made from a spiced tomato and cashew paste that is then sautéed with onions, more spices and herbs, has a lovely tang to it and is full of flavor. The addition of sugar and cream give the dish a creamy and faintly sweet taste.  
            You need your regular Indian pantry staple ingredients to make this restaurant style paneer lababdar recipe
            Tomatoes: Giving the dish a bit of tang, tomatoes are an important ingredient in the gravy. Be sure to choose tomatoes that aren’t too tangy or sour.
            Cashews: The creamy consistency in paneer lababdar comes from cashews. The cashews are ground to a paste with the tomatoes. Cashews also add a lovely sweetness to the dish.
            Cream: Adding cream also adds to the sweetness and richness in the paneer lababdar gravy making it a restaurant style dish.
            Onions: In the curry, onions are not pureed, but chopped and lightly caramelized. Thus they add some sweetness and a slight sharp flavor to the curry.
             Spices and Herbs: Most of the spices and herbs used in this recipe are common and you probably already have them in your kitchen. The garam masala powder can be purchased, but is also a great spice to make from scratch and have on hand. Here I share the recipe for making Garam Masala Powder.
             Paneer (Indian cottage cheese): This is the main ingredient in the dish and it is important to use a good quality paneer. In fact, as with all my paneer recipes, I recommend using Homemade Paneer. This ensures freshness and avoids any hidden ingredients and preservatives found in store-bought paneer
